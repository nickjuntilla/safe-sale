# Sale based on pre-made token.

This codebase can be used to deploy fixed-price, finite-supply token sales. The price and time window can be changed. It uses json conf files to specify sale parameters. The token must be generated and migrated FIRST then added to the conf. Tokens MUST be transfered into the contract for the contract to function. A token can be generated from github/nickjuntilla/token Once the token is migrated use the address generated from the console.

# Initialize
This was developed using Node 8.2.1, Truffle 3.4.5 and TestRPC 4.0.1.

```
npm install -g truffle
npm install
truffle compile
```

# Using the repo to deploy a real token
Config files where the parameters of your own sale can be filled in are in the `conf` directory.

Note that the `owner` in `sale.json` MUST BE the first address generated by the mnemonic in `secrets.json`. Note that you MUST change the default mnemonic in `secrets.json` or you WILL BE PWNED. Once you've done that you MUST NEVER commit your `secrets.json`. KEEP IT SECRET. It is in the .gitignore. Do not commit it once you've changed it. If your production mnemonic is compromised you are fully pwned.

Having done all that you can `truffle migrate --network mainnet`. Save the contents of your build directory, you'll want to have all that data.
